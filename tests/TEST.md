# How to run the tests
we are using cypress to test the component


## Make sure you have latest version of Node js (12+)


## How to run the tests
- Go to tests folder
- Install node modules `npm install`
- Install serve module to  run the server `npm install -g serve`
- Run the server `npm run server` 
- Run the tests `npm run test` 


FYI, there is a video under tests/assets folder about all tests are passing.
